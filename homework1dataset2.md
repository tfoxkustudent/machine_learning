# Sweet Robot Moves and K Means
This project is the the second data set where I used my kmeans algorithm to cluster data and find centroids of data. I picked the robot moves data set from kaggle to use my algorithm on. I picked the y-axis to be Reading 1 and the x-axis to be Reading 2. These are readings that the robot takes in and then makes a decision for what move to make. I used different colors to cluster the different moves the robot made. Go into terminal and run command python3 cluster_robot_moves.py You will see four different boxes pop up. The top two boxes are the data points plotted, one with robot moves in color and the other with non-colored data. This gives you an opportunity to see the data points plotted. The bottom two graphs show the kmeans algorithm vs the actual known robot moves.

# How the K Means Algorithm works:
So first we initialize the kmeans class with our training data and the number of clusters we want. Then we randomize the number of data points and use the first number of points to randomly place our centroids. We then iterate through every data point and calculate the distance for every centroid. we then pick the minimum distance and determine the nearest centroid and store that into an array. We then go through the associated data points to each centroid and calculate the total mean for those data points, then we are able to place the centroid based on that calculation. We then interate through this process a certain amount of times to achieve the minimum distance for our clusters and their associated data points.

# Conclusion
There is fairly good correlation with the readings from the robot and the decisions it makes for moves.  My kmeans algorithm did not do a great job at making the same clusters as the actual clusters.  Mainly with the slight-right-turn and the move forward.  In the future I would like to make adjustments to be able to automatically be able to calculate K without passing a value in.
